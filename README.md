🩺 Disease Prediction
📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning model that predicts diseases (heart disease in this case) using patient health data.
It is implemented in Python with Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook and applies ML algorithms for classification and prediction.

I created this project for learning purposes by following and getting inspired from Ihsan Mishra’s work.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Training ML models for disease prediction

Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

Easy-to-use notebook with CSV dataset

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

NumPy, Pandas → Data handling

Scikit-learn → Machine learning algorithms

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization

📂 Project Structure
Disease-Prediction/  
│── Disease_Prediction_System.ipynb   # Main notebook  
│── heart_dataset.csv                 # Dataset  
│── Heart_user_template.csv           # Sample input  
│── README.md                         # Documentation  

▶️ Usage

Open Disease_Prediction_System.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

Run the notebook step by step

Train the model with the dataset

Test predictions using Heart_user_template.csv

🔮 Future Improvements

Add more datasets for different diseases

Build a web app using Streamlit/Flask

Try deep learning models for higher accuracy

Deploy to cloud (Heroku/AWS/GCP)
